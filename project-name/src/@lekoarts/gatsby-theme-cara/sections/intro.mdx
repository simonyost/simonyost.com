# Hi, I'm Simon Yost

My super power is finding clarity in the mess so that tribes can thrive.

I am a husband, father, [technology leader](http://1904labs.com/), [podcast host](http://catchfire.show/), amateur cyclist, and
self-professed coffee aficionado. My interests include foster/adopt parenting and Nebraska football.
