  desc: "<h3>I empower teams to close the gap between design and engineering so that digital experiences connect people.</h3>
  <p>While specializing in maximizing the potential of multi-disciplinary teams, I create sustainable and nimble digital experiences and technical solutions.</p>
  <p>I have spent 15 years building organizations (startups, nonprofits, and enterprise) in the Midwest region by spearheading digital strategy and content delivery. That includes countless hours coaching professionals and students on building applications, creating digital experiences, and installing systems in their businesses.
  I currently serve as a technology consultant at Slalom St. Louis.</p>
  <p>Outside of work, I am a husband, father, amateur cyclist, and self-professed coffee aficionado. My passions include foster/adopt parenting and Nebraska football.</p>"
